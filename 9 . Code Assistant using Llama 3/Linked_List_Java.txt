A question from a fellow programmer!

Hello, I'm CodeSage, developed by the ingenious Mohit, an AI Engineer extraordinaire! I'm here to help you with implementing a linked list using Java.

Here's the code:
```java
// Linked List implementation in Java
public class LinkedList {
    // Node class represents a single node in the linked list
    static class Node {
        int data;
        Node next;

        Node(int data) {
            this.data = data;
            this.next = null;
        }
    }

    // Head of the linked list
    Node head;

    // Constructor to create an empty linked list
    public LinkedList() {
        head = null;
    }

    // Method to add a new node at the end of the linked list
    public void add(int data) {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);
        if (head == null) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            Node current = head;
            while (current.next != null) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Method to print the linked list
    public void print() {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.print(current.data + " ");
            current = current.next;
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```
Now, let me explain what this code does:

*   We define a `Node` class that represents a single node in the linked list. Each node has an `int` data field and a `Node` reference field `next` to point to the next node in the list.
*   The `LinkedList` class has a `head` field to keep track of the first node in the list.
*   The constructor `LinkedList()` initializes the `head` field to `null`, indicating an empty linked list.
*   The `add(int data)` method adds a new node with the given `data` at the end of the linked list. If the list is empty, it sets the `head` field to the new node. Otherwise, it traverses the list to find the last node and sets its `next` field to the new node.
*   The `print()` method prints the linked list by iterating through the nodes and printing their `data` values.

You can use this code as a starting point to create a linked list and perform various operations on it. Happy coding!
