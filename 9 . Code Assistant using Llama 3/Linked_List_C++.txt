Now, let's dive into the world of linked lists using C++!

**Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Node structure to represent a single element in the linked list
struct Node {
    int data; // Data stored in the node
    Node* next; // Pointer to the next node in the list
};

// Linked list class to manage the nodes
class LinkedList {
private:
    Node* head; // Head of the linked list

public:
    LinkedList() : head(nullptr) {}

    // Add a new node to the end of the linked list
    void add(int data) {
        Node* newNode = new Node();
        newNode->data = data;
        newNode->next = nullptr;

        if (head == nullptr) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            Node* current = head;
            while (current->next != nullptr) {
                current = current->next;
            }
            current->next = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Print the elements of the linked list
    void print() {
        Node* current = head;
        while (current != nullptr) {
            std::cout << current->data << " ";
            current = current->next;
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    LinkedList list;

    // Add some elements to the linked list
    list.add(1);
    list.add(2);
    list.add(3);
    list.add(4);
    list.add(5);

    // Print the linked list
    list.print();

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

This code implements a basic linked list using C++. Here's a breakdown of the code and its components:

*   **Node Structure:** The `Node` struct represents a single element in the linked list, with two members: `data` to store the data and `next` to point to the next node in the list.
*   **LinkedList Class:** The `LinkedList` class manages the nodes in the linked list. It has a private member `head` to keep track of the head of the list.
*   **Add Method:** The `add` method adds a new node to the end of the linked list. It creates a new node with the given data and updates the `next` pointer of the last node in the list to point to the new node. If the list is empty, it sets the `head` to the new node.
*   **Print Method:** The `print` method traverses the linked list and prints the data of each node.
*   **Main Function:** The `main` function creates an instance of the `LinkedList` class, adds some elements to the list, and then prints the linked list.

This code provides a fundamental understanding of linked lists in C++. You can build upon this foundation to create more complex data structures and algorithms. Happy coding!
