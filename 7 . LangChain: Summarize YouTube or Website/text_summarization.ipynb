       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 0}, page_content='A P J Abdul Kalam Departing speech \\n \\n \\nFriends, I am delighted to address you all, in the country and those living abroad, after \\nworking with you and completing five beautiful and eventful years in Rashtrapati \\nBhavan. Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a question from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and assured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \\n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \\nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \\nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \\nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade.

Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat.

The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp.

Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a question from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and assured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \\n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \\nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \\nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \\nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master. Despite the severe l oss due to the earthquake, '),\n",

They interacted with me and said \\nthat the school was functional in the temporary tents. Here, I also witnessed the \\nparticipation of acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir along with State Government \\nauthorities in on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to be provide d to the victims whose \\nhouses had been damaged in the earth quake. I have experienced many s uch acts of \\ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \\n \\nCourage in combating calamities \\nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha village \\nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South \\nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot project on tele-education and \\ntele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.

      "Speech : In his departing speech, former President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, expresses his gratitude for the opportunity to serve the country for five eventful years. He shares ten important messages that he has gathered from his interactions with people from various walks of life. The messages include accelerating development, empowering villages, mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness, focusing on agricultural growth, defeating problems and succeeding, overcoming problems through partnership, showing courage in combating calamities, promoting connectivity for societal transformation, defending the nation with pride, and encouraging a youth movement for Developed India 2020. The message that stands out is from a little girl named Anukriti, who asked him why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020, inspiring him to emphasize the need to accelerate development and fulfill the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the thoughtful question and assured the individual that their dream will be brought to the nation's highest institution and will be worked upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker discusses the aspirations of India's youth to live in a developed country by the year 2020, and how this desire should guide professionals in their work. The speaker then recounts a visit to Nagaland, where they saw an empowered village council making financial decisions and overseeing a prosperous village. The speaker highlights the need for physical connectivity, such as quality roads, to connect villages to markets. They then discuss the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's initiative to provide urban amenities in rural areas, including physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, resulting in employment generation and entrepreneurship. The overall message is the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural resources for competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech focuses on the development of Periyar PURA villages through employment generation and entrepreneurship supported by self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land have been transformed into cultivable land, with villagers engaged in growing Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, bio-mass power generation, food processing, and running marketing centers. This sustainable economic model has significantly improved the region's growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past eight months, the villagers have collaborated with experts from Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) to develop prototypes for 55 lifestyle products, utilizing local core competence and raw materials. This cooperative venture has enhanced the innovative abilities of the villagers, enabling them to create internationally acceptable products. The aim is to establish 7000 PURA projects nationwide to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seed-to-food concept is crucial for agricultural growth, implying that the focus should be on the entire agricultural value chain from seed to food, ensuring sustainable agricultural development and growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker recounts their experience of meeting over 6000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, who took a keen interest in the gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker had previously summarized practical suggestions given by farmers during a national symposium on agriculture. They emphasize the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources while improving the nation's economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. The speaker encourages empowering farmers to protect and nurture fertile land for a second green revolution, and expresses confidence that agricultural GDP growth will increase by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a separate incident, the speaker shares their experience of meeting a man named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs but had a radiant face and a happy state of mind. Krishna Murthy thanked God, his parents, teachers, and others for giving him confidence, training, and help. When the speaker asked what they could do for him, Krishna Murthy said he didn't need anything from them and instead offered to sing for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes two different experiences of the speaker. In the first experience, the speaker talks about a musically talented individual who, despite being physically challenged, has a positive attitude and perseverance, which has allowed his talent to blossom. Encouraged by parents, teachers, and academics, he wants to use his music to inspire others. The speaker is touched by his performance and his desire to give back to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second experience, the speaker talks about visiting Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, which was recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2005. The school building was severely damaged, but the villagers praised the role of the Army, Air Force, and state government in rescue and relief operations. Despite their severe losses, the villagers showed courage and resilience, becoming masters of their problems rather than allowing the problems to control them. The speaker appreciates their indomitable spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The message of the speech is one of perseverance, resilience, and the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity. Whether it is through the medium of music or the strength of community, the speaker highlights the importance of partnership and the human capacity to triumph over disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the bravery of children and members of a village who participated in relief operations with the Armed Forces after an earthquake. The acting Chief Justice and State Government authorities were present to provide relief grants to the affected victims. The speaker recounts a previous experience in 2005 when they met tribal council leaders and children in Chuckchucha village, Car Nicobar Islands, during the reconstruction and rehabilitation activities after the Tsunami. The islanders had taken in affected victims as their own children, demonstrating their courage and unique trait of caring for each other. The speaker composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" which they sang with the gathered members, expressing their determination to overcome challenges with the grace of the Almighty. The speaker also addressed the Pan African Parliament in 2004, emphasizing the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech introduces the proposal for a Pan African e-Network, a project to create a seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries.

The network aims to connect 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 super-specialty hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa. A pilot project for tele-education and tele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned.

      "The speech discusses two main topics: Tele-consultation services provided to Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and the defense forces of India.\n",
      "\n",
      "In regards to the tele-consultation services, Hyderabad has been offering one-hour live tele-consultations to doctors in Black Lion Hospital in Cardiology and Radiology since November 2006, using the Pan African network to connect the Heads of State in all 53 countries for instant communication. The speaker expresses pride in India's ability to use technology to benefit people in Africa and bring about societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second topic of the speech is the defense forces of India. The speaker shares their personal experiences of visiting the Indian Army in Siachen Glacier, traveling in the INS Sindhurakshak, and flying in a Sukhoi-30 fighter. They express admiration for the soldiers, sailors, and air warriors who perform their duties beyond the call of duty in adverse circumstances. The speaker also acknowledges the contributions of the para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in ensuring the safety and security of Indian citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the speaker mentions a recent meeting with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens, indicating support for this movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lead India 2020 Foundation, founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan in Hyderabad, is training thousands of students in various districts of Andhra Pradesh, including Medak, in partnership with the District Administration. The training has resulted in visible changes in students, such as increased self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. An example of this transformation is Ms. Padma, a student leader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda, who inspired her father to quit smoking after attending the Lead India Training Camp. The goal of the program is to empower the youth, who make up 540 million of the country's population under the age of 25, through value-based education and leadership. The speaker is optimistic about the future of the country, given the richness of India's traditions and the efforts being made by various agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage while also pursuing economic growth. They highlight the country's progress and natural resources, as well as the hardworking people, particularly the youth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation before 2020 and encourages the empowerment of individuals who wish to contribute to the nation. The speaker then outlines five goals for developed India 2020: reducing the rural-urban divide, ensuring equitable distribution and access to energy and quality water, promoting harmony between agriculture, industry, and services, providing education without societal or economic discrimination, and becoming a top destination for scholars, scientists, and investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a ideal nation, which includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Universal access to top-notch healthcare services.\n",
      "2. Responsive, transparent, and corruption-free governance.\n",
      "3. Eradication of poverty and illiteracy, with an end to crimes against women and children and a society where everyone feels included.\n",
      "4. A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and content nation on a sustainable growth trajectory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, in his speech, expressed gratitude for the love and support he received during his tenure as President of India. He shared his life mission to bring connectivity and self-confidence to the people of India, with a goal of developing the nation by 2020. He concluded with a blessing and a \"Jai hind.\"\n",

Kalam advocates for the establishment of 7000 such PURA models to bridge the rural-urban divide and foster agricultural growth. He has gained confidence from meeting with over 6000 farmers and 20 agricultural scientists, that the nation is poised to increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries, particularly for value addition. He encourages addressing problems with a positive mindset, as illustrated by his encounter with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a man with no hands and legs, who radiated happiness and contentment. Furthermore, Kalam shares his experience of the indomitable spirit of the people and children of Jammu & Kashmir, who, despite recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2005, displayed resilience and courage in facing their losses, showcasing the potential of human spirit to overcome adversities. He appreciates the role of the Army, Air Force, and state government in providing relief and aid to the affected residents.\n",

       "'In his farewell speech, former President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, expresses gratitude for his tenure and shares key messages derived from his experiences with various communities. He emphasizes the need to accelerate development, specifically addressing the aspirations of the youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. Kalam highlights the significant strides made in rural development through the PERIYAR PURA model, which has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land and empowered 1000 self-help groups to generate employment and create entrepreneurs. The PURA model has enabled the development of internationally competitive lifestyle products, enhancing the innovative ability of the rural populace. Kalam advocates for the establishment of 7000 such PURA models to bridge the rural-urban divide and foster agricultural growth, with a goal of increasing agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum.\\n\\nKalam encourages addressing problems with a positive mindset, as illustrated by his encounter with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. He shares his experience of the indomitable spirit of the people and children of Jammu & Kashmir and advocates for global connectivity through the Pan African e-Network, a project aiming to provide seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries. This project includes connecting 12 universities and 17 super specialty hospitals from India and Africa, along with 53 tele-medicine and tele-education centers in Africa.\\n\\nKalam is dedicated to defense and security, expressing pride in the Indian military and para-military forces for their commitment to protecting the nation. He is encouraged by initiatives such as the Lead India 2020 program, which aims to build an empowered and informed nation with a vision of a developed India by 2020. Furthermore, Kalam emphasizes the importance of a robust healthcare system, good governance, poverty eradication, women and child safety, and overall prosperity and happiness for all citizens.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Kalam shares his mission in life - to bring connectivity between the billion hearts and minds of Indian people in the multicultural society and to embed the self-confidence that \"we can do it\". He will continue to be with the citizens in the great mission of making India a developed nation before 2020. Kalam aspires for a nation that is one of the best places to live in and is proud of its leadership, where the best of healthcare is available to all, governance is responsive, transparent and corruption-free, poverty has been totally eradicated, illiteracy removed, and crimes against women and children are absent. His vision is a prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy India that continues on a sustainable growth path.\\n\\nOriginal summary:\\n\\nIn his farewell speech, former President of India, A.P.J.
